Created a Real time face emotion detection using mediapipe.Here the face of the person is collected using opencv and face key points are collected and stored in a csv.
By using that data created a model using sklearn.Created models using random forest,logistic regression,ridge clasifier,knn,svm algorithms.Since Random Forest givess the best 
accuracy It is used as the final model.
<ul>
<li>The coord_emotion.csv.zip contains the csv file which contains the keypoints collected. 

<li>To Run Real Time detection just run test.py </li>
</ul>
